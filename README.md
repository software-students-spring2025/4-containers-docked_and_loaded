# User Stories
- As a user, I want to start the game by clicking a "Start" button so that I can begin playing rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
- As a user, I want the application to recognize my hand gestures for rock, paper, or scissors so that I can play the game without using a keyboard or mouse.
- As a user, I want to see real-time feedback on my gesture recognition so that I can confirm that my choice has been correctly identified before the round begins.
- As a user, I want the computer to randomly select its gesture (rock, paper, or scissors) so that I can compete against it in the game.
- As a user, I want to see the results of each round (win, lose, or draw) so that I can track my performance against the computer.
- As a user, I want to see my score and the computer's score displayed on the screen so that I can keep track of who is winning throughout the game.
